# Overview

This sensor works for either SPI or I2C, in this case the driver was implemented for SPI only, to be used on the STM32 board.

Now this sensor required the following config:

- 20 MHz clock speed
- SPI mode 0

## Usage Example

You can copy the following code to quickly test the driver:

```c


void main(){
    MS5611_init();
    int32_t temp, pressure;
    
    while(1){
        temp = MS5611_read_temp();
        pressure = MS5611_read_pressure();
        // show data to lcd, etc.
    }
}

```
